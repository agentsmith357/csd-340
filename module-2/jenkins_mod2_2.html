    <h1>Assignment 2.2 â€“ Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>

    <p class="intro">I grew up in Tampa, Florida and lived here most of my life.  I enjoy that this area is mainly hot and the beachs are close.</p>

    <p>I now live with my wife and daughter in Riverview. <span class="sentence">We love spending time at home watching movies and doing crafts.</span> Family time is very important to us and we try to make the most of our weekends.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is working with technology. I enjoy coding and building things that help make life easier. Learning new tools keeps me motivated every day.</p>

    <p>I also like going on road trips and exploring nature. Visiting new places helps me relax and recharge. Florida has so many hidden gems that are perfect for weekend getaways.</p>
